# Quilt Thing
Kimberlea Heili

A little database to keep track of the patterns I have purchased or am interested in.

This project uses HTML, CSS, PHP, and JS. (index.php, index.view.php)
Will include the ability to manage patterns - remove, delete, add, and edit

--

index.html is for display purposes only! This does not use PHP or JS.
